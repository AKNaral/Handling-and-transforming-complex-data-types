The importance of understanding how to manipulate data efficiently, especially when working with complex, imperfect data sets.


Normalize Dates: Extracting components of dates (year, month) from MO_ID, casting them into integers, and then converting them into a usable date format demonstrates a deep understanding of data types and their conversions.

Date Arithmetic: The use of ADD_MONTHS and various arithmetic operations to calculate customer age and tenure highlights the significance of mastering SQL functions for precise time-based calculations.

Optimization and Handling Edge Cases: The frequent use of COALESCE and default conditions like "Unknown" ensures that missing data is handled gracefully, which is key to robust data pipelines.
